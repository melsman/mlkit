# This is the MLKit main workflow for building and testing the MLKit
# on various architectures.  The workflow contains a job called
# "build-test-deploy". It is triggered on push or pull request events
# on the master branch. It is also triggered when a tag is pushed, in
# which case a binary distribution is deployed. The build matrix is
# currently setup to run only with mlton as the primary SML compiler.
