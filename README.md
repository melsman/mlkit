## MLKit

The [MLKit](http://elsman.com/mlkit) is a compiler for the programming language Standard ML. The
MLKit covers all of Standard ML, as defined in the 1997 edition of the
Definition of Standard ML and supports most of the Standard ML Basis
Library.

## Test Statistics and Benchmarking

[![CI](https://github.com/melsman/mlkit/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/melsman/mlkit/actions) [Benchmarking](https://elsman.com/mlkit-bench/)

## Installation

Under macOS, MLKit is available through Homebrew: Just execute `brew
install mlkit`. Under Linux, you may install a binary version of MLKit
using an [mlkit PPA from Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/~pmunksgaard/+archive/ubuntu/mlkit).


## MLKit Features

* Covers all of Standard ML. The MLKit compiles all of Standard ML,
  [including Modules](http://elsman.com/mlkit/staticinterp.html),
  as specified by the Definition of Standard ML. The MLKit also
  supports large parts of the [Standard ML Basis Library](http://elsman.com/mlkit/basis.html).

* Supports [ML Basis Files](http://elsman.com/mlkit/mlbasisfiles.html):
  The MLKit compiles large programs,
  [including itself](http://elsman.com/mlkit/bootstrap.html), around 80.000 lines of Standard ML plus the
  Standard ML Basis Library. The support for ML Basis Files makes it
  easy to compile a program with different Standard ML
  compilers. Currently, both [MLton](http://mlton.org) and the MLKit supports the concept
  of ML Basis Files. The MLKit works well together with [smlpkg](https://github.com/diku-dk/smlpkg), a
  generic package manager for Standard ML libraries and programs.

* Region-Based Memory Management: Memory allocation directives (both
  allocation and deallocation) are inferred by the compiler, which
  uses a number of program analyses concerning lifetimes and storage
  layout. The MLKit compiler is unique among ML implementations in
  this respect.

* Reference-tracing Garbage Collection: The MLKit supports
  reference-tracing garbage collection in combination with region-based
  memory management.

* Native backend for the x64 architecture (under Linux and macOS).

* [Documentation](http://elsman.com/mlkit/doc.html). A
  comprehensive guide on programming with the MLKit is
  available. Documentation is also available in man-pages and from the
  [MLKit home page](http://melsman.github.io/mlkit).

## MLKit Cousins

This repository also includes the sources for the following tools,
which are built on top of MLKit:

* [SMLToJs](/README_SMLTOJS.md). A compiler that compiles all of Standard ML into JavaScript.

* [Barry](/README_BARRY.md). A Standard ML source-to-source compiler
  that will eliminate modules, using static interpretation and
  generate optimised Core-language Standard ML code.

## License and Copyright

The MLKit compiler is distributed under the GNU Public License,
version 2. See the file [MLKit-LICENSE](/doc/license/MLKit-LICENSE)
for details. The runtime system (`/src/Runtime/`) and libraries
(`basis/`) is distributed under the more liberal MIT License.

## Compilation Requirements

To compile, install, and use the MLKit, a Linux box running Ubuntu
Linux, Debian, gentoo, or similar is needed. The MLKit also works on
macOS and has also earlier been reported to run on the FreeBSD/x86
platform, with a little tweaking.

To compile the MLKit, a Standard ML compiler is needed, which needs to
be one of the following:

__[MLton](http://mlton.org) >= 20051202:__
````bash
$ mlton
MLton 20051202 (built Sat Dec 03 04:20:11 2005 on pavilion)
````

If a version prior to 20201023 is used, you may need to adjust the
`mlton`-flags setup in the file `Makefiledefault`.

__A working MLKit compiler >= 4.3.0:__
````bash
$ mlkit -V
MLKit version 4.3.0, Jan 25, 2006 [X86 Backend]
````

Moreover, `gcc` is needed for compiling the runtime system and related
tools.

## Compilation

After having checked out the sources from Github, execute the command:
````bash
$ ./autobuild
````

Now, `cd` to the toplevel directory of the repository and execute the
appropriate set of commands:

__Compile with MLton alone (Tested with 3Gb RAM):__
````bash
$ ./configure
$ make mlkit
````

__Compile with existing MLKit (Tested with 1Gb RAM):__
````bash
$ ./configure --with-compiler=mlkit
$ make mlkit
````

If you later want to install the MLKit in your own home directory, you
should also pass the option `--prefix=$HOME/mlkit` to `./configure` above.

For binary packages, we use
````bash
$ ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc --prefix=/usr
````

## Bootstrapping (optional - works with 1Gb RAM)

This step is optional. If you want the resulting executable compiler
to be bootstrapped (compiled with itself), execute the command:
````bash
$ make bootstrap
````

Be aware that this step takes some time.

## Pre-compile Basis Library and Kit-Library

Execute the following command:
````bash
$ make mlkit_libs
````

## Installation after Compilation

For a system wide installation of the MLKit, installation including
man-pages and tools, execute the command:
````bash
$ sudo make install
````

For a personal installation, with `--prefix=$HOME/mlkit` given to
`./configure`, execute the following command:
````bash
$ make install
````

## Making a Binary Package

To build a binary package, execute the command
````bash
$ make mlkit_x64_tgz
````

This command leaves a package `mlkit-X.Y.Z-x64.tgz` in the `dist/`
directory. For building a binary package, the installation step above
is not needed and the bootstrapping step is optional.

For building packages containing both MLKit and SMLtoJs, consult the Makefile.

## Try It

To test the installation, copy the directory `/usr/share/mlkit/kitdemo` to
somewhere in your own directory, say `$HOME/kitdemo`:
````bash
$ cp -a /usr/share/mlkit/kitdemo $HOME/kitdemo
$ cd $HOME/kitdemo
$ mlkit helloworld.sml
````

The MLKit should produce an executable file `run`:
````bash
$ ./run
hello world
````

## Trying Without Installing

You can run `mlkit` without installing it, but you should then point
the environment variable `SML_LIB` at the build directory (which
contains the `basis` and the `lib` directories) whenever you run
`mlkit`.  E.g:

```bash
$ SML_LIB=$PWD bin/mlkit
```

## Appendix B: Quick Compilation and Installation Guide

We assume that MLton >= 20051202 is installed on the system as
described above.

After having checked out the sources from Github, execute the command:
````bash
$ ./autobuild
````

To compile the MLKit, execute the following commands:
````bash
$ ./configure
$ make mlkit
$ make bootstrap
$ make mlkit_libs
````

The `make bootstrap` command is optional.

To install the MLKit and related tools, execute:
````bash
$ sudo make install
````

See the section "Try It" above to test the installation.

## Appendix C: Displaying Region Flow Graphs with VCG

The [VCG tool](http://www.cs.uni-sb.de/RW/users/sander/html/gsvcg1.html) can be used to show region flow graphs.
