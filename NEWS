MLKit NEWS file

              **** MLKit version 4.3.0 is released ****

 * mael 2006-01-27: Summary of major changes since 4.1.4

      - Updated Basis Library

      - Support for separate compilation with MLB-files

      - Garbage collection of regions is now the default

      - Improved documentation - man-pages, wiki, etc.

      - Various bug-fixes

 * mael 2006-01-27: Added Makefile entry for constructing a source
   distribution (in directory kit/dist/). Run 'make mlkit_src_tgz'.

 * mael 2006-01-26: Added Makefile entry for constructing a binary
   distribution (in directory kit/dist/). After running 'make
   bootstrap' (see below), run 'make mlkit_i386_tgz'.

 * mael 2006-01-26: Simplified the bootstrap process: after runnig
   './configure' and 'make nj', simply run 'make bootstrap'; see the
   README file for details.

 * mael 2006-01-26: Updated license information, which is now
   available in the doc/license directory; see the file MLKit-LICENSE.

 * mael 2006-01-24: Garbage collection is now used by default in
   combination with gc. To disable garbage collection, the flag -no_gc
   should be passed to the mlkit executable.

 * mael 2006-01-06: Added support for annotations in
   mlb-files. Currently, only the flag safeLinkTimeElimination is
   supported, which helps linking in parts of the basis library only
   when it is needed. See the file basis/basis.mlb for an example.

 * mael 2005-12-12: The MLKit menu system is no longer supported - it
   has now been removed from the sources. Instead, the user of the
   MLKit must provide options to the executable. To get an overview of
   which options are available, type "mlkit -h" on the command line.

 * mael 2005-12-12: The MLKit Manual (kit/doc/manual/mlkit.pdf) is
   now updated to document the support for MLB-files. Notice that
   pm-files are no longer supported; see below.

 * mael 2005-12-04: Fixed bug related to where .bdy-files (functor
   bodies) are stored. They are now stored in the MLB-directory of the
   functor-hosting mlb-file.
 
 * mael 2005-11-29: Started work on updating the Standard ML Basis
   Library implementation - see

     http://www.itu.dk/research/mlkit/index.php/MLKit_Basis_Library_Implementation

   for getting an overview of the status.

 * mael 2005-11-11: Finished work on generational garbage
   collection. The mlkit option -gengc can now be used to construct
   executables that combines generational garbage collection and
   regions. Pass the -help option to the generated executable to see
   which runtime options are available; the option -only_major_gc can
   be used to disable minor garbage collections. Statistics can be
   printed on stderr using the options -verbose_gc or -report_gc (the
   option -verbose_gc somewhat slows down the executable). NOTE:
   generational gc is still experimental - there is at least one bug we
   need to track down.

 * varming 2005-11-01 Added some Posix support needed to build
   KitTester + some more.

 * mael 2005-11-01: Using MLton 20050731, mlton successfully compiled
   the MLKit, resulting in a very fast (but large) mlkit executable -
   cool. Notice that MLton 20041109 is buggy and doesn't compile the
   MLKit correctly; see http://mlton.org/Bugs20041109.

   To compile the MLKit with mlton, the following commands were used
   (on abacus.itu.dk):

     $ cd /home/mael/kit/src/Compiler
     $ /home/mael/mlton-20050731/build/bin/mlton @MLton ram-slop 0.7 gc-summary -- \
	  -drop-pass deepFlatten -verbose 3 native.mlb
     $ cp native /home/mael/kit/bin/mlkit_mlton2005
     $ ls -l /home/mael/kit/bin/mlkit_mlton2005
     -rwxr-xr-x  1 mael users 105135787 Nov  1 09:35 /home/mael/kit/bin/mlkit_mlton2005
     $ strip /home/mael/kit/bin/mlkit_mlton2005
     $ $ ls -l /home/mael/kit/bin/mlkit_mlton2005 
     -rwxr-xr-x  1 mael users 58855368 Nov  1 13:51 /home/mael/kit/bin/mlkit_mlton2005

   To compile the MLKit again with mlkit_mlton2005, use the following
   command:

     $ ../../bin/mlkit_mlton2005 /home/mael/kit -gc native.mlb

   Executing this command generates an executable file run:

     $ ls -l run
     -rwxr-xr-x  1 mael users 11353914 Nov  1 14:22 ./run
     $ strip ./run
     $ ls -l run
     -rwxr-xr-x  1 mael users 7603544 Nov  1 14:36 ./run

   Thus, albeit faster, the size of the mlkit_mlton executable is 8
   times the size of the mlkit_mlkit executable.

 * mael 2005-10-04: Bootstrapping. Bootstrapping now works with the
   native backend:

     > cd kit
     > make clean
     > ./configure
     > make mlkit
     > rm -rf ~/mlkit-v1
     > make bootstrap_first INSTDIR=$HOME/mlkit-v1
     > cd ~/mlkit-v1
     > rm -rf ~/mlkit-v2
     > ulimit -s unlimited
     > make bootstrap_next INSTDIR=$HOME/mlkit-v2
     > cd ~/mlkit-v2
     > rm -rf ~/mlkit-v3 
     > make bootstrap_next INSTDIR=$HOME/mlkit-v3
     > cd ..
     > strip ~/mlkit-v2/bin/mlkit.img
     > strip ~/mlkit-v3/bin/mlkit.img
     > diff ~/mlkit-v2/bin/mlkit.img ~/mlkit-v3/bin/mlkit.img
     >

 * mael 2005-09-27: Added very limited Posix support necessary for
   bootstrapping. See basis/POSIX.sml.

 * mael 2005-09-25: Region profiling is now supported with mlb-files.
   When "-prof" is passed to the mlkit executable, each region/
   effect variable gets a unique id (threaded through the 
   compilation). The solution applied is to add an option to the
   mlkit executable: -regionvar N. With this option, the first
   generated region variable gets id N+1. The compiler stores a
   pair (first regionvar, last regionvar) in a file f.rev after having
   compiled f.sml. For each compilation, mlbmake reads the last
   regionvar from the previous fn.rev-file M, which is then used with
   -regionvar M in compilation of f(n+1).sml.

 * mael 2005-09-24: The mlkit no longer accepts .pm-files. The
   mlkit executable accepts files with the following extensions:

     .mlb: batch-based compilation of projects following the
        mlb-syntax; starts a new process for each source-file
        compilation. The mlb-subsystem uses the -c, -load, and -link
        options for compiling individual source files into object code
        and for linking object code.

     .{sml,sig}: Compiling a file F with extension .sml or .sig, without
        use of the -c flag, is similar to compiling the mlb-file:

           local $(SML_LIB)/basis/basis.sml
           in F
           end
         
        If the flag -c is used, no executable is generated;
        instead interface files (extensions .{eb,eb1}) are generated
        together with linkable object code. The option -load may be
        used for loading interface files before compilation. These
        options are used by the MLB compilation subsystem.

   For both .mlb-files and .sml-files, the -o flag allows for
   specifying a different output file than a.out.

 * mael 2005-07-15: Fixed KitTester (src/Tools/Tester) so that it
   accepts mlb-files in the grammar for tst-files instead of
   pm-files. Also, simplify the system to allow only the following
   annotations:

       nobasislib     ; do not import basis library
       ccl            ; compare compiler logs
       tx             ; time executable
       tc             ; time compiler
       ecte           ; expect compile time error
       ue             ; expect uncaught exception

    The annotations "prof", "gc", and "gengc" should not be supported
    - in this way, the same tst-file can be used for all tests
    (kam-backend,native-backend,test of gengc, test of gc, test of
    profiling, etc). For this to work, KitTester should accept options
    that can be redirected to the MLKit executable for each test
    program compilation.

 * mael 2005-07-15: Fixed bug related to recompilation of functors. If
   a functor is modified, the .bdy-file for the functor body is
   modified, but the eb-file for the file in which the functor was
   declared was not necessarily modified upon a change in the source
   file (which could cause a lack of recompilation). The fix inserts
   an md5-sum of the .bdy-file in the functor closure in the eb-file
   for the file in which the functor is declared. Thus a change in the
   source code for the function will now result in a change in the
   eb-file.

 * mael 2005-05-10: Integrated mlb-file support in mlkit
   executable. For full isolation, the implementation forks a
   different process for each compilation of a source file.

 * mael 2005-02-22: The grouping of source code for mlb-files (shown
   below) is now also used for cm-files when the MLKit is compiled
   with SML/NJ. See e.g. kit/src/build.sml and kit/src/build_kam.sml.

 * mael 2004-12-17: To actually split sources so that Barry,
   SMLserver, Kit(native) and Kit(bytecode) can be built
   independently, we have the following mlb-hierachy (transitive
   dependencies are omitted), where the mlb-files in boxes denote main
   mlb-files that, when built, result in mlkit executables:

          pickle.mlb      edlib.mlb
              \             /  
               \           /     
                 tools.mlb           
                    |
                    |
             syntax_objects.mlb
                    |
                    |
            special_objects.mlb
                /         \   
               /           \
    compiler_objects.mlb   basics.mlb
              \             /  
               \           /     
                manager.mlb  
                    |
                    |
               compiler.mlb
                /         \   
               /           \
          +---------+       \
          |barry.mlb|    regions.mlb
          +---------+    /        \
                        /          \
                 +----------+   +------------+
                 |native.mlb|   |bytecode.mlb|
                 +----------+   +------------+
                  
 * mael 2004-12-16: Defunctorized much of the MLKit sources to make
   bootstrapping more tractable with the new recompilation scheme
   (serialization of bases). There are now MLB-files and CM-files for
   compiling MLKit, so that it can be compiled both with SML/NJ,
   MLton, and MLkit itself. Compiling with MLton on my 1GB(+1GB swap)
   does not work - I suspect more memory is needed. I hope it
   works when I try it on a 4GB machine.

 * mael 2004-12-15: Changed directory kit/basislib to kit/basis and
   kit/basislib/basislib.pm to kit/basis/basis.pm.

 * mael 2004-12-14: mlbmake: It is now checked that a source file
   (i.e., sml-file) is included at most once in an entire MLB
   source-hierarchy. MLB-files may be referred to multiple times,
   although recursive references to MLB files are not allowed.

 * mael 2004-12-14: mlbmake: As suggested by Stephen Weeks we now use
   $(SML_LIB) as a path variable for refering to a root for the MLB
   libraries. Thus, programmers can now use $(SML_LIB)/basis/basis.mlb
   to refer to the basis library in both MLKit and MLton.

 * mael 2004-08-05: Bug fix: bug reported by Stephen Weeks
   concerning type scheme generalization is now fixed (see
   kit/test/weeks6.sml).

 * mael 2004-08-04: Finished initial work on supporting export of ML
   functions to C. Only functions of type int->int may be exported at
   present and the support works only with pure region based memory
   management (i.e., without reference tracing garbage
   collection). See the example export.mlb in the test directory.

 * mael 2004-08-02: Initiated work on supporting export of ML
   functions to C. The special identifier "_export" is now declared in
   the initial environment with type \/'a,'b . string * ('a -> 'b) ->
   unit. In a call _export("myFun",fn a:int => a+1), the string
   "myFun" is the name of the assembled function (following C calling
   conventions), and the function (fn a:int => a+1) is the ML function
   called when the C function "myFun" is called from C code.

           **** MLKit version 4.1.4 is released ****

 * mael 2004-06-09: Work initiated on pickling (serializing) compiler
   bases to disk so as to obtain a more flexible recompilation system
   that does not require users to compile all program code whenever
   the MLKit interactive menu system is launched.

 * mael 2003-05-14: Added three new distinct region types to allow 
   for generational garbage collection of regions with untagged 
   pairs, untagged triples, and untagged references. Generational
   garbage collection with regions is not yet fully implemented.

 * mael 2003-05-13: Reals now only take up three words (instead of
   four) when tagging is enabled.

 * mael 2003-05-08: Fixed bug related to free type variables in type
   bindings.

 * mael 2003-02-18: Added support for inlining of functor
   applications. To specify that functor applications in a file should
   be inlined, one can now write inline specifications in pm-files 
   using the syntax 'inline funapps in ... end'. Inlining of functor 
   applications improves performance, because it triggers
   optimizations, such as function inlining, but it also slows down
   recompilation.

 * mael 2002-12-05: Fixed bug in opacity elimination
   (test/opaque3.sml).

 * mael 2002-12-05: Fixed bug concerning free type variables at
   top-level in local function (test/ftv.sml).

       **** MLKit version 4.1.3 is released (internally) ****

 * mael 2002-11-08: Implemented uncurrying of functions. This
   optimization has an important impact on execution times of compiled
   programs. The optimization is safe-for space w.r.t. the region-based
   memory management. The optimization can be disabled with the option
   -no_uncurry.

 * mael 2002-11-05: Improved pattern-match compilation. The generated
   code now shares (in most cases) the extraction of values from the
   root node in a match.

       **** MLKit version 4.1.2 is released (internally) ****

 * mael 2002-10-28: Started work on Barry - a Standard ML barifier
   (e.g., simplifier). Barry eliminates modules, pattern matching,
   complex derived forms, resolves infix resolution, and performs a
   series of optimisations. Barry is basically the frontend of the ML
   Kit with a pretty printer, which outputs intermediate language
   constructs in the MLKit (LambdaExp fragments) as Standard ML
   code. See the file kit/README_BARRY.

 * mael 2002-10-25: Support for untagged representation of pairs when
   garbage collection is enabled.

 * mael 2002-09-20: Fixed bug caused by Timing.checkRealTimer raising
   exception Time on some systems when -timing flag is used.

 * mael 2002-09-17: Added FreeBSD support - patches contributed by 
   Koshy A Joseph.

           **** MLKit version 4.1.1 is released ****

 * mael 2002-08-25: Removed Posix support due to licensing problems 
   with code from mlton.

 * mael 2002-08-25: Removed region type real. Added region type 
   pair for implementation of almost tag-free garbage collection -
   not yet fully implemented.

           **** MLKit version 4.1.0 is released ****

 * mael 2002-04-06: Manual improved -- the pdf-version of the manual
   now uses Type 1 fonts, exclusively.

 * mael 2001-12-16: Posix bug-fixes. Runtime system clean-up. 
   Change of prim-function for interfacing with C. It is easier 
   now to interface with C functions that take regions as 
   arguments; a few macros help generate different code when 
   profiling is enabled.

 * mael 2001-12-13: Ported Posix structure from MLton. Calls to C
   are in many cases simpler now because auto-conversion is 
   extended to work with a larger set of types, including 
   strings (and CharArrays).

 * mael 2001-11-25: Assembler in-lining of sub/update/size 
   operations on bytetables (CharArray, Word8Array, CharVector, 
   Word8Vector, String).

 * mael 2001-11-24: Better implementation of Array/Vector (constant
   subscripting/updating).

 * mael 2001-11-24: Better implementation of CharArray/Word8Array 
   (basislib/ByteTable.sml); no ref-indirection.

 * mael 2001-11-24: Better implementation of strings/arrays/vectors
   by supporting large objects in the runtime system; values that do
   not fit in region pages are now allocated with malloc and placed
   in a list of large objects in the region descriptor for the 
   region. Upon region de-allocation, the large objects are freed 
   using free.

 * mael 2001-11-20: Better reporting of garbage collection statistics
   and fragmentation (runtime flag -verbose_gc, when gc is enabled).

 * mael 2001-11-15: Unboxing of datatypes. Previously, only a certain
   set of predefined types were implemented unboxed. Now, enumerations
   and many other simple datatypes, such as trees, are represented
   unboxed; file src/Compiler/Lambda/CompileDec.sml.

 * mael 2001-11-02: Bug fix involving Int32 operations in the presence
   of profiling and GC; file src/Compiler/Backend/FetchAndFlush.sml.

 * mael 2001-11-01: Added structures Pack32Little, Pack32Big, IntInf
   to basis library implementation; implementations are ported from 
   SML/NJ.

 * mael 2001-10-30: Bug fix involving unboxing of function arguments
   in OptLambda.sml; see test file test/unbox.sml.

 * mael 2001-10-30: Bug fix involving manipulation of compiler bases
   when restricting interpretation bases in ManagerObjects.sml; see
   test file test/functor3.sml.

 * mael 2001-10-26: Bug fix involving recursive value bindings; see
   test programs test/valrecpat.sml, test/valrecpat1.sml,
   test/valrecpat2.sml, test/valrecpat3.sml, and test/valrecpat4.sml.

 * mael 2001-10-26: Bug fix involving polymorphism and parallel
   value bindings. Bug reported by Stephen Weeks; see test program
   test/weeks5.sml.
 
 * mael 2001-10-23: Bug fix in X86-backend; when tagging is enabled an
   Overflow exception was raised when the largest Word31-word appeared
   in a pattern.

 * nh 2001-10-20: The Garbage Collection algorithm now uses two stacks;
   one for infinite regions and one for finite regions. Each finite
   region is only traversed once and it is still a non-recursive
   algorithm. The stack size is determined dynamically.

 * mael 2001-10-14: It is now possible to disable region inference in
   the MLKit by specifying the flag no_region_inference (or no_ri) on
   the command line. The flag has the effect that all infinite regions
   are collapsed with the top-level infinite regions
   (DropRegions.sml). The option has no effect on finite regions;
   and region parameters may still happen to be instantiated to either
   finite or infinite regions (the top-level ones).

 * mael 2001-09-30: Added regular expression support (structure RegExp) 
   to the basis library. The implementation is based on an 
   implementation by Ken Friis Larsen. See the file 
   kit/basislib/REG_EXP.sml for details.

 * mael 2001-09-30: Program manager changes: (1) It is now 
   possible for two files in different subdirectories to have the same
   name and be listed in the same pm-file. (2) Target-files generated
   when compiling a pm-file (i.e., uo-files for the bytecode backend
   and o-files for the native x86 backend) are now stored in a PM
   directory located in the same directory as the compiled pm-file is
   located; this change allows for a pm-file to refer to source files
   located in directories for which the user does not have 
   write-permission.
   
           **** MLKit version 4.0.0 is released ****

 * mael 2001-08-16: Fixed bug in separate compilation framework; match
   function in ClosConvEnv functor was non-exhaustive.

 * mael 2001-07-19: Added Interrupt exception to front end; it is
   now possible to handle an Interrupt exception raised by pressing
   Control-C.

           **** MLKit version 3.9.1 is released ****

 * mael 2001-07-05: Bug fix: valrec may now overwrite identifier
   status. Bug reported by Johnny Andersen.

 * mael 2001-07-05: Quotation support. When the option -quotation is
   given to the compiler at startup, the datatype 
      datatype 'a frag = QUOTE of string | ANTIQUOTE of 'a
   is available in the top-level environment. Moreover, the character
   ` cease to be allowed in symbolic identifiers. Values of the 'a
   frag datatype may be constructed using the quotation/antiquotation
   syntax:
        val s = "world" 
        val a : string frag list = `hello ^s - goodbye`


 * mael 2001-07-05: An uncaught exception now causes the program to
   return -1 to the shell (instead of 0). Suggestion by Stephen Weeks.

 * mael 2001-07-05: Bug fix: The function OS.FileSys.tmpName now
   returns a file name for a file in /tmp/ (instead of in /etc/). Bug
   reported by Stephen Weeks.


           **** MLKit version 3.9.0 is released ****

 * many bug fixes

 * replaced HP backend with x86 native backend

 * bytecode backend added as an alternative to the x86 native backend;
   primarily, the bytecode backend is added for portability and for
   use with the SMLserver project, which adds Standard ML language
   support to AOLserver -- a webserver from America Online
 
 * added support for reference tracing garbage collection

 * Word31, Word32, Word8, Int31 and Int32 structures added


[1998-12-03]   **** MLKit version 3.0 is released ****

 * ...

[1997]         **** MLKit version 2.0 is released ****

 * ...

[1993]         **** MLKit version 1.0 is released ****
