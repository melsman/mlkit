mael 2008-10-19: Make a filesys abstraction FSys that allows for
source files and target files to be stored in a database or in the
file system. The MLKit should then use this abstraction for accessing
files. The abstraction should be general in the sense that it should
support all kinds of files, including binary files, but still, it
should support being implemented using a proxy so that sources can be
stored on a server, compiled on clients and targets stored on the
server.

mael 2008-10-18: When an mlb-path-map references a non-existing file,
mlkit reports:

 Stopping compilation due to errors.
 SysErr

We need a better error message in this case...

mael 2007-07-09: There is a bug concerning checking of changes in
dependent mlb-files. Update mael 2008-10-28: .d-files (e.g.) for a
file should contain the hosting mlb-file in the name in order for the
dependency checks to work correctly...

mael 2007-04-19: Check before using a library that it has been
compiled with the same version of the mlkit that tries to use the
library. It can be discussed how rigid this check could be. A simple
check just serializes the string (Version.svn_rev ^
Version.configure_date) into all serialized objects. For a less
simple, but more bullet-proof check, we need to use a unique id
generated at build time (not at autoconf or configure time). We can
take an MD5 sum of the machine name and the current time and date.

mael 2007-04-19: Better error reporting for errors in MLB-files.

mael 2007-02-26: Things to do:

 - runtime flags only if env var MLKIT_RUNTIME_FLAGS is set.

     Instead use the syntax:

       a.out @MLKit -help --
       a.out @MLKit -help -- a b c
         means: print runtime help options and exit

       a.out @MLKit -verbose_gc -- a b c
         means: enable runtime option -verbose_gc and make options [a, b, c]
         available to the application.

mael 2005-11-29: Things needed for the next release:

   * mael 2006-01-24: Don't do a gc during exit...

mael 2005-10-28: Fix bug in gengc: Errors when bootstrapping

mael 2005-10-25: Add necessary Posix-support needed to compile
Kittester with MLKit. DONE (Varming)

mael 2005-10-25: MLB-make needs to check the integrity (e.g., size) of
.{eb1,eb,lnk,rev}-files before concluding that recompilation is not
needed. It is sufficient to check the integrity of lnk-files since
lnk-files are generated last. DONE.

varming 2005-09-05: Upgraded SMLserver to Apache. Started work on 
configuration prior to compilation (autoconf).

 > cd kit
 > autoconf -o configure configure.ac
 > autoheader configure.ac
 > ./configure

Generates apropriate Makefiles to build the kit. To build SMLserver
try configure --enable-SMLserver --with-apache=/path/to/apache 
To build oracle driver configure --enable-SMLserver 
--with-apache=/path/to/apache --with-oracle=/path/to/oracle

mael 2005-09-02: Both "make mlkit", "make smlserver", and "make
mlkit_kam" works. Running the regression tests on mlkit and mlkit_kam
also works:

 > cd kit/test
 > export SML_LIB=/home/mael/mlkit/kit
 > rm -rf MLB ../basis/MLB
 > make test_mlkit
 > rm -rf MLB ../basis/MLB
 > make test_kam

To run "make smlserver", first the AOLserver rpm must be
installed. Then, after the build of smlserverc, do as follows:

   cd kit/smlserver_demo/www
   export SML_LIB=/home/mael/mlkit/kit
   ../../bin/smlserverc demo.mlb

This should construct a file www/MLB/demo.ul. Currently, msp-files are
not supported.

Things to do:

  - Upgrade to Apache. (Carsten)
  - Setup and test separate compilation mechanisms
  - Setup regression testing for different compile time options, such 
    as "-gc", "-prof", "-gc -prof" (Martin)


mael 2004-12-14: The definition of a "basis closure" is
inappropriately strong. More information than necessary is included in
the closure, which means that serialized bases take up a large amount
of space on disk. This is not entirely correct; some information is
not included in a basis closure; see test/functor

mael 2005-05-27: Things to do:

 - With different combinations of options, code should be stored in
   different MLB sub-directories. There are different kinds of options:

    1) Options that influence the generated code and which runtime system
       is used:
         region profiling, gc, gengc, tagging schemes

    2) Options that influence the generated code, but not which runtime
       system is used:
         lambda optimizations, enabling/disabling of storage mode
         analysis/multiplicity inference

    3) Options that do not influence the generated code:
         pretty-printing options
         verbosity options (chat,debug)
       
   For computing a subdirectory of MLB to store target code, etc., we
   sort all options in category (1) and (2); call this list of options
   L and the list of option values V.

    val s = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789-_"
    val sz = size s (*=64*)
   
   This allows for the encoding of 6 option values for each character.
   Divide V into lists of 6-tuples (pad with true values for possible
   missing entries in the last tuple). Interpret each tuple as a
   number between 0 and 64 (binary interpretation;
   TRUE=1;FALSE=0). Index into s to get a character for each 6-tuple.


  mlbmake: Make tool that calls mlkit for each source file in the
           mlb-file hierachy. When a single sml-file f.sml is given as
           argument to mlbmake, the following mlb-file is constructed
           and compiled: 'local $(SML_LIB)/basis/basis.mlb in f.sml end'.

mael 2004-12-13: Status on MLB files.

It is now possible to compile the MLKit itself using
MLB-files. Unfortunately, a segmentation fault occurs when compiling
General.sml with the generated executable - compilation of Initial.sml
goes well. 

Some things to do:

  * Check for cycles in MLB-graph. - OK

  ** fix bug (see above)

  * rewrite tests to use mlb-files instead of pm-files - OK

  * modify test-utility to call mlbmake instead of mlkit when
    the argument is an mlb-file. Alternatively, exec mlbmake from
    within mlkit when the argument is an mlb-file. - OK

  * Extend mlbmake to take a single sml-file "file.sml" as
    argument. Its semantics should then be similar to
      local $(SML_LIB)/basis/basis.mlb in file.sml end  - OK 

mael 2004-10-30 Plan for mlb-files implementation in the MLKit.

Status: It is now possible to compile simple mlb-files and have
export-basis information stored on disk for each compilation unit. A
"dependency analysis", which is run before compilation units are
compiled, determines which exported export-bases a compilation unit
depends on.

Things to do:

 1) Move the MLB implementation outside of the MLKit, so that it can
    be used also by the Moscow ML compiler. Figure out what
    command-line features should be supported by the MLKit executable
    (or Moscow ML):

        mlkit -c -o myfile -load u1.eb ... uN.eb file.sml   // generates myfile.{eb,o,li}
        mlkit -o a.out -link u1 ... uN                   // generates a.out

 2) Optimize loading of export bases so that only infix and elaboration
    bases are loaded for all {u1.eb ... uN.eb} in
         
        mlkit -o myfile -load u1.eb ... uN.eb file.sml

    After the infix and elaboration bases are loaded, the program unit
    can be parsed and elaborated into a typed abstract syntax
    tree. Once the program unit has been elaborated, free identifiers
    of the program unit can be found [Els98, Chapter 4]. From this
    information, the subset U of {u1,...,uN} necessary for compilation
    can be found.

Possible things to do
---------------------

mael 2003-03-05: better pretty-printing of type variables. In
particular, types with more than 20 (or so) type variables in them are
not nicely pretty-printed in error messages and signatures (e.g., '}
should instead be 'aa). Also, it would be great if we could reuse the
name of the type variable as it occurs in the source program (e.g.,
write 'kind instead of 'aa).

mael 2003-02-04: nicer pretty-printing of signatures (mlkit
-sig). Particularly, parameterized type constructors have an extra
space.

mael 2001-11-27: curry-compression: turn

    let f = \x.let g = \y.e1 in \z.e2
    in e3
    end

into

    let f = \x.\z.let g = \y.e1 in e2
    in e3
    end

Let C be the contexts defined by

    C[.] := .
          | let f = \x.e in C[.]
Turn
    let f = \x.C[\y.e1] in e2  
into
    let f = \x.\y.C[e1] in e2

mael 2001-11-13: turn curried functions into functions that take
  multiple arguments; build the closure at the call-site for those
  functions that are not fully applied:

    let f = \x1...\xn.e in (...(f e1)...en)  ==>
    let f = \<x1...xn>.e in f <e1,...,en>
      

mael 2001-11-12: better cross-module in-lining; support in-lining of
  non-closed functions.

mael 2001-11-12: don't built closures for top-level functions; all
  free variables of such functions are either (1) top-level functions,
  which by induction have no environment, or (2) top-level variables,
  which are statically allocated.

mael 2001-11-12: unboxed implementation of datatypes that
  have any number of nullary constructors but at-most three unary
  construtors that all take boxed arguments. With gc, only two unary
  constructors are allowed for the datatype to be implemented
  unboxed. Examples of datatypes that may be implemented unboxed
  include (1) The list datatype, (2) enumerations, (3) the Binary
  tree datatypes in kit/basis/Binarymap.sml,
  kit/basis/Binaryset.sml, kit/basis/Intmap.sml,
  kit/basis/Intset.sml, kit/basis/Polyhash.sml,
  kit/basis/Splaymap.sml, and kit/basis/Splayset.sml, (4)
  Patricia trees (kit/src/Common/IntFinMapPT.sml), and (5) Union Find
  data structure (kit/src/Compiler/Kam/UnionFindPoly.sml.)
  
mael 2001-11-12: unboxed implementation of datatypes that
  have only one unary constructor; in most cases this optimisation is
  captured by the unboxing mentioned above.

Large elaboration bases are annotated on the ast (functor bindings)
during elaboration. Such annotated bases cause opacity elimination to
be slow when compiling large programs; opacity elimination applies
realisations to ast annotated objects. To improve speed of
compilation, we should restrict the annotated bases to those
identifiers that occur free in the functor binding. Is it possible to
do this restriction during the pass for finding free identifiers
(FreeIds)?
 
Implement some kind of project reuse; it currently takes too long for
the manager to find out that the code for the basis library can be
reused. The problem is that the result basis for the basis library
project is reconstructed, from the result bases for the individual
sources of the library, every time the project is reused.

Variables that occur free in a program unit are associated with
labelled slots in the data segment of the final executable; thus,
these variables need not be stored in closures. It suffices to fetch
them from the data segment.

Currently, we do not treat multiple declarations of the same functor
identifier in the same project. We can allow this; but we cannot allow
a functor identifier to be declared more than once in a source file.

Allow in-lining of functors and pre-processing through
ML-Yacc and ML-Lex. Syntax:

     bdy ::= inline funidseq                     functor inlining
          |  local bdy in bdy end                local
	  |  bdy bdy |  _                        sequential
          |  file.sml | file.sig                 source file
          |  file.o                              precompiled object
          |  file.grm                            yacc source file
          |  file.lex                            lex source file

Declare polymorphic eq. in the initial basis, and make it impossible
to redeclare equality; if equality is in the initial basis then
in-lining happens automatically.

How are we going to model the differences between the specification of
the Math structure and the semantics of /usr/include/math.h? For now,
I think that we should just do whatever math.h does; MosML does not
implement NaN, posInf, and negInf; instead, MosML raises Overflow when
the specification suggests to return NaN, posInf, or negInf.

Implementation of Real.round on systems that do not have rint() (i.e.,
systems based on gcc's library). Real.round is broken in MosML, so we
cannot copy the code.

Why are regions that are passed to primitive functions in the runtime
system not tested for resetting automatically (in CompLamb);
currently, the user must do the resetting in the C function. Is there
a reason? What about Mogensens idea about resetting?
