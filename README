                       The MLKit sources

This README file describes the structure of the MLKit sources as well
as necessary steps for compilation and either personal or system wide
installation.

An overview of the directory structure of the distribution is given in
Appendix A. 

*NOTE*: For a quick compilation and installation guide, see Appendix B.

1. Introduction
---------------
The MLKit is a compiler for the programming language Standard ML. The
MLKit covers all of Standard ML, as defined in the 1997 edition of the
Definition of Standard ML and supports most of the Standard ML Basis
Library.

Features:

  * All of Standard ML. The MLKit compiles all of Standard ML,
    including Modules, as specified by the Definition of Standard
    ML. The MLKit also supports large parts of the Standard ML Basis
    Library.

  * Supports ML Basis Files: The MLKit compiles large programs,
    including itself, around 80.000 lines of Standard ML plus the
    Standard ML Basis Library. The support for ML Basis Files
    makes it easy to compile a program with different Standard ML
    compilers. Currently, both MLton and the MLKit supports the
    concept of ML Basis Files.
 
  * Region-Based Memory Management: Memory allocation directives (both
    allocation and deallocation) are inferred by the compiler, which
    uses a number of program analyses concerning lifetimes and storage
    layout. The MLKit compiler is unique among ML implementations in
    this respect.

  * Reference-tracing Garbage Collection: The MLKit supports
    reference-tracing garbage collection in combination with region
    memory management.

  * Native backend for the x86 architecture.

  * Documentation. A comprehensive guide on programming with the MLKit
    is available in the doc/ directory. Documentation is also
    available in man-pages and from the MLKit home page

                http://melsman.github.io/mlkit

2. License and Copyright
------------------------
The MLKit compiler is distributed under the GNU Public License,
version 2. See the file doc/license/MLKit-LICENSE for details. The
runtime system (kit/src/Runtime/) and libraries (kit/basis/) is
distributed under the more liberal MIT License.

3. Compilation Requirements
---------------------------
To compile, install, and use the MLKit, a Linux box running Ubuntu
Linux, Debian, gentoo, or similar is needed. The MLKit also works on
Mac OS and has also earlier been reported to run on the FreeBSD/x86
platform, with a little tweaking.

To compile the MLKit, a Standard ML compiler is needed, which needs to
be one of the following:

 (1) MLton >= 20051202. A link to the home page for MLton is available
     from the MLKit home page. The command sml should be available
     from the prompt:

       $ mlton
       MLton 20051202 (built Sat Dec 03 04:20:11 2005 on pavilion)

 (2) A working MLKit compiler >= 4.3.0. The command mlkit should be
     available from the prompt:

       $ mlkit -V
       MLKit version 4.3.0, Jan 25, 2006 [X86 Backend]

Moreover, Gcc is needed for compiling the runtime system and related
tools.

4. Compilation
--------------
After having checked out the sources from Github, execute the command:
 
 $ ./autobuild

Now, cd to the toplevel directory of the package. Execute the commands
under (a) or (b):

  a. Compile with MLton alone (Tested with 3Gb RAM)
  -------------------------------------------------
   $ ./configure 
   $ make mlkit

  b. Compile with existing MLKit (Tested with 1Gb RAM)
  ----------------------------------------------------
   $ ./configure --with-compiler=mlkit
   $ make mlkit

If you later want to install the MLKit in your own home directory, you
should also pass the option --prefix=$HOME/mlkit to ./configure above.

For binary packages, we use

   $ ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc --prefix=/usr

5. Bootstrapping (optional - works with 1Gb RAM)
------------------------------------------------
This step is optional. If you want the resulting executable compiler
to be bootstrapped (compiled with itself), execute the command:

 $ make bootstrap

Be aware that this step takes some time.

6. Pre-compile Basis Library and Kit-Library
--------------------------------------------
Execute the following commands:

 $ make mlkit_libs

7. Installation
---------------
For a system wide installation of the MLKit, installation including
man-pages and tools, execute the commands - as root:

 % make install

For a personal installation, with --prefix=$HOME/mlkit given to
./configure, execute the following commands:

 $ make install

8. Making a Binary Package
--------------------------
To build a binary package, execute the command

 $ make mlkit_i386_tgz

This command leaves a package mlkit-X.Y.Z-i386.tgz in the dist/
directory. For building a binary package, step 7 is not needed and
step 5 is optional.

9. Try It
---------
To test the installation, copy the directory /usr/share/mlkit/kitdemo to
somewhere in your own directory, say $HOME/kitdemo:

 $ cp -a /usr/share/mlkit/kitdemo $HOME/kitdemo
 $ cd $HOME/kitdemo
 $ mlkit helloworld.sml

The MLKit should produce an executable file "run":  

 $ ./run
 hello world

10. More Information
--------------------
See the MLKit home page

   http://melsman.github.io/mlkit

Documentation for the MLKit is located in the directories doc/mlkit
and man/man1. License information is located in the file
doc/license/MLKit-LICENSE.

11. VCG
-------
The VCG tool, which is used to show region flow graphs, can be found
at http://www.cs.uni-sb.de/RW/users/sander/html/gsvcg1.html

12. Comments and Bug Reports

Appendix B: Quick Compilation and Installation Guide
----------------------------------------------------
We assume that MLton >= 20051202 is installed on the system as
described in Section 3.

After having checked out the sources from Github, execute the command:
 
 $ ./autobuild

To compile and install the MLKit, execute the following commands:

 $ ./configure
 $ make mlkit
 $ make bootstrap
 $ make mlkit_libs

Execute as root:

 % make install

See Section 9 for how to test the installation.
